# lets-talk


This is a messaging application by Steven Tat.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, first clone the repo and `cd` into the directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/steventat/lets-talk.git 
$ cd lets-talk
```

Then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Install JavaScript dependencies:

```
$ yarn install
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
